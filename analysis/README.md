# Data Setup

To run the analysis, ensure your local environment follows the expected directory structure:

1. **Create the data directory:**
```bash
   mkdir data
```

2. **Download Groundedness Data:** Download `groundedness.csv` from OSF ([A Grounded Typology of Word Classes](https://osf.io/bdhna)) and move it into the `data/` folder.

3. **Download BLOOM Data:** Download the `BLOOM_processed_data` and `BLOOM_word_surprisal` folders from OSF ([Grounded UID](https://osf.io/rh3dn)) and move them into the `data/` folder.

**Note:** The analysis scripts assume this specific data structure by default.
